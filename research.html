                <ul>
                    <li class="description">A lot of work says people generalize negative outcomes more than positive (e.g., if Restaurant A is good/bad, does that mean nearby Restaurant B will be better/worse?). Some work says the opposite. We show prior beliefs (e.g., whether restaurants are generally more good than bad) can explain both findings. Using a new methodology accounting for prior beliefs, we are the first to show that people generalize positive information more, all else equal.</li>

                    <li class="description">Past work says that people believe profits come at the expense of consumers. We find people actually like companies with increasing profits because they believe profits indicate how much the company sold, not how much it exploited its customers.</li>
